There are some pre filled test values in the data base based on number of when they were inserted, Dont panic I just didnt want to make 10 users to clear them out or break my database by deleting them, so some will show up when creating new accounts. There are 3 users already so that you can see premade values. they are (username password) zach 123, sam 123,Goose 123. Thanks for a great semester marc!
